                    <p>You've mapped your inheritance. Now you dig deeper. Every path has a source. Every voice in your head has an origin. Every value you hold was planted by someone, somewhere, sometime.</p>

                        <p>Tracing the source is <strong style="color: var(--path-primary);">archaeology</strong>. You are excavating the layers of influence that shaped you—family, culture, trauma, media, peers—and naming them one by one. Not to blame. To understand. To see clearly who has been walking in your shoes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Until you trace the source, you cannot separate your voice from the chorus of others. You cannot know which thoughts are yours and which were installed without consent.</p>
