                    <p>You are not a solitary walker. Every step you take is influenced by the people around you - for better or worse. Some relationships lift you, carry you, show you the way. Others weigh you down, drain your energy, lead you off your path.</p>

                        <p>Relational ground is the honest inventory of your human connections. Not social media followers. Not LinkedIn connections. Not acquaintances you see twice a year. The people who would actually show up if you needed them - and the people who drain you even when you don't.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This practice is uncomfortable because it requires honesty about relationships you may have taken for granted. But you cannot build on ground you haven't surveyed.</p>

                            <p>Every interaction either gives you energy or takes it. Some people leave you feeling more alive. Others leave you drained for hours. This is not about good or bad people - it's about fit and reciprocity.</p>
