                    <p>Most people rush to answers. They want to know their purpose, their calling, their meaning — immediately. But meaning isn't found by demanding an answer. It emerges from holding the question open, walking toward it, letting it reveal itself over time.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card" style="background: rgba(100, 181, 246, 0.05); border-color: var(--path-primary);">
                        <p><strong style="color: var(--path-primary);">Meaning is not discovered in the ground. It's forged through walking.</strong> You don't find your purpose like you find lost keys. You build it, step by step, by moving toward what matters to you.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This first practice is not about answering "What is my purpose?" It's about holding the question, letting it work on you, and beginning to notice where your attention already goes.</p>
                </section>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Not "What is my purpose?" That's too heavy, too final. The question is about <strong style="color: var(--path-primary);">direction</strong>, not destination. What pulls you? What interests you? What problems do you keep returning to?</p>
